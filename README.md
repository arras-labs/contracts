- Prepare deployment artefacts for each environment

## Tech stack
TBD (e.g., Foundry or Hardhat, Solidity)

## Structure
- `src/` contract sources
- `test/` unit and integration tests
- `scripts/` deployment and maintenance scripts
- `out/` build outputs (ignored in VCS unless noted)

## Getting started

- Build and run tests locally

## CI
Build and test on pull requests and pushes to `main`.

## Security
